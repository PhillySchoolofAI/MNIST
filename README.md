# MNIST
(Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The images are 28Ã—28px.

Half of the training set and half of the test set were taken from NIST's training dataset, while the other half of the training set and the other half of the test set were taken from NIST's testing dataset.
